# Machine-Learning-Driven-Insurance-Charges-Prediction

The Methodology used here:

* Implemented data preprocessing techniques including handling missing data, scaling, and feature engineering to prepare the insurance dataset for model training.

* Developed a feature selection process using techniques such as correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

* Applied machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict insurance premiums based on customer demographics and policy details.

* Optimized model hyperparameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to improve prediction accuracy.

* Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score to ensure robust predictions.
